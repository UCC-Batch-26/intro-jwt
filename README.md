# Introduction to Authentication

This project demonstrates basic authentication concepts using Express.js. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity. It's a fundamental security mechanism that ensures that users are who they claim to be before granting access to protected resources.

## What is Authentication?

Authentication is like showing your ID card before entering a restricted area. In web applications, it typically involves:

1. **User Identity Verification**: Checking if the provided credentials (usually username/email and password) are valid
2. **Session Management**: Keeping track of authenticated users
3. **Access Control**: Determining what resources an authenticated user can access

Common authentication methods include:
- Username/Password authentication
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- OAuth/Social login
- Biometric authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install required packages including:
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `body-parser`: Middleware to handle request body parsing

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the app in development mode with auto-reload enabled. The server includes:
- Debug mode with `--inspect` flag
- Auto-restart on file changes with `--watch` flag

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Main application entry point
- `modules/`: Contains authentication-related modules
- REST endpoints for user authentication
